## `/tendon_transmission_node` Namespace

### Source
`ros-helix/helix_transmission/helix_transmission/tendon_transmission.py`

### Topics

`~/commands` `Float64MultiArray[9]`
- Commands the arm tendon position setpoint in [m], relative to the calibrated tendon 0 position, within the configured limits.

`~/current_commands` `Float64MultiArray[9]`
- Commands the arm tendon current in [mA], within the configured limits.

`~/tendon_states` `JointState[9]`
- Position and velocity of arm tendons.

### Services

`~/tendon_transmission_node/set_current` `helix_transmission_interfaces/SetCurrent`

```
float64 current 0.0
---
bool success
string message
```
- Sets all arm tendon current commands to the [mA] value of `current`, within the configured limits.

`~/set_motor_offsets` `std_srvs/Trigger`
- Sets all arm tendon 0 calibration point to the current state, by writing the current motor joint positions to the calibration offsets file.

`~/switch_to_current_control` `std_srvs/Trigger`
- Switches all motor controllers to current mode so that position commands will be ignored.

`~/switch_to_position_control` `std_srvs/Trigger`
- Switches all motor controllers to position mode so that current commands will be ignored.

## `/helix_gripper_node` Namespace

### Source
`ros-helix/helix_gripper/helix_gripper/helix_gripper.py`

### Topics

`~/command_increment` `Float64`
- Moves the gripper tendon by the value in [m], clipped to the configured limit.

## `/helix_cartesian_control_node` Namespace

### Source
`ros-helix-proprietary/helix_cartesian_control/helix_cartesian_control/helix_cartesian_control_node.py`

### Topics

`~/dxdyl_state` `JointState[9]`
- The DxDyL state of the model `[Dx1, Dy1, L1, Dx2, Dy2, L2, Dx3, Dy3, L3]`. Generally updated whenever the model state changes, such as when the model is used to calucalte a Cartesian command, or if the DxDyL state is commanded directly.

`~/cartesian_state` `PoseArray[4]`
- Cartesian poses of the 3 arm section end frames `seg1_end_link`, `seg2_end_link` and `seg3_end_link`, and the gripper TCP frame `helix_tcp`. Calculated from the model FK and updated whenever `~/dxdyl_state` is published.

`~/dxdyl_command` `Float64MultiArray[9]`
- Direct `[Dx1, Dy1, L1, Dx2, Dy2, L2, Dx3, Dy3, L3]` command, which is converted to tendon lengths and commanded as an immediate setpoint. 

`~/delta_increment`  `TwistStamped`
- Incremental Cartesian command for the gripper TCP, applied in the `frame_id` supplied in the header (which defaults to `origin`). The components of `twist.angular` are applied as rotations around the extrinsic/static axes.

### Services

`~/reset_model` `std_srvs/Trigger`
- Reset the model to the initial/calibration state, and also command tendons to the zero/calibrated lengths.

`~/activate_joystick_control` `std_srvs/Trigger`
- Activate teleoperation control by connecting the `spacenav/twist` topic to `~/delta_increment`.

`~/deactivate_joystick_control` `std_srvs/Trigger`
- Deactivate teleoperation control by disconnecting the `spacenav/twist` topic from `~/delta_increment`.

`~/go_to_gripper_pose_vector` `helix_transmission_interfaces/GoToGripperPoseVector`

```
string frame_id
geometry_msgs/Point goal_point
geometry_msgs/Vector3 goal_direction
bool plan_linear
bool ik_uses_prev
---
bool success
string message
```
- Move the gripper to a goal defined by a gripper TCP point and vector direction.

`~/go_to_gripper_pose_quat` `helix_transmission_interfaces/GoToGripperPoseQuat`
```
string frame_id
geometry_msgs/Pose goal_pose
bool plan_linear
bool ik_uses_prev
---

string message
```
- Move the gripper to a goal defined by a gripper TCP point and quaternion direction.

`~/go_to_gripper_pose_euler` `helix_transmission_interfaces/GoToGripperPoseEuler`
```
string frame_id
geometry_msgs/Point goal_point
float64[3] goal_euler_angs
string axes "sxyz"
bool plan_linear
bool ik_uses_prev
---
bool success
string message
```
- Move the gripper to a goal defined by a gripper TCP point and Euler angle set direction.
